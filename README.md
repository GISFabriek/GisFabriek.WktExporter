**GisFabriek.WktExporter**

This repository contains an ArcGIS Pro 2.4 Add-In consisting of a Toolbar Tab with two buttons.

The first button exports one single Geometry to a WKT string. The geometry to be exported is the first one encountered in the selected items of the Feature Layers.

The second button imports one single WKT string as a Feature into the selected Feature Layer (provided that the Feature Layer contains the correct geometry type)
